  st8: 'Learnings',
  t8: "Taking on a project in progress, without having been part of the initial alignment and with the MVP already defined, presented a significant challenge. However, this experience allowed me to question the decisions made and evaluate if they were truly aligned with the product and business objectives. As a result, I was able to review the internal strategy and identify potential improvement opportunities for future projects. This experience taught me the importance of constantly evaluating decisions and ensuring they align with the overall goals of the project and the company. It also helped me develop skills in adaptation and problem-solving in an ever-changing environment. I look forward to applying these learnings in future projects and contributing even more to the company's success."
